Then the user went back to the main menu and tried the “local delivery or pickup option” and then the user was able to locale a store near them and see how far away it was.

                    Levain Bakery is quite famous all around the world. I would assume that many individuals would want to learn how this popular 6 pound cookie came to be. And it seems like the owners know too because this was the easiest task. When attempted, the user made no mistakes and remembered even, seeing the button of “Our Story” in the main menu.

                    A big part of the website is wanting to order the cookies. I wanted the user to try and find a list of their flavors. The user did not find any specific button so they had to start browsing. They clicked “Cookie Club” but nothing was there, they found a carrousel with what seemed to be bundles but then there were two flavors. Finally, they hovered over nationwide shipping and saw “Shop all cookies” and they were able to find them.

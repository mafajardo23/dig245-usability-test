                    In this first task, the idea was for the user to be able to look for the closest store near them. The user thought that the button “OUR BAKERIES” was the correct one. They started to browse around but there wasn’t really any information on wether or not there was a close store or how far or close was it. Then the user went back to the main menu and tried the “local delivery or pickup option” and then the user was able to locale a store near them and see how far away it was.

                    Levain Bakery is quite famous all around the world. I would assume that many individuals would want to learn how this popular 6 pound cookie came to be. And it seems like the owners know too because this was the easiest task. When attempted, the user made no mistakes and remembered even, seeing the button of “Our Story” in the main menu.

                <div class="task_info">
                    A big part of the website is wanting to order the cookies. I wanted the user to try and find a list of their flavors. The user did not find any specific button so they had to start browsing. They clicked “Cookie Club” but nothing was there, they found a carrousel with what seemed to be bundles but then there were two flavors. Finally, they hovered over nationwide shipping and saw “Shop all cookies” and they were able to find them.

                In this task, the idea was for the user to see how long would the cookies take to ship. There was no tab that sad this information so the user had to go into the checkout tab but the pop up message is distracting and feels way too small in order to operate. The user had to write the address for confirmation even though the calendar popup already included the prices.

                To do this task, there wasn’t necessarily a button or a menu where this option seemed like it would be included. However the user started browsing and luckily enough, she found some of the companies in which Levain has been featured in.
